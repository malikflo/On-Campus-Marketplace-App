Group 11 Project Proposal
Project Title: On-Campus Marketplace App
Detailed Description: Group 11 proposes the development of an On-Campus Marketplace 
App designed exclusively for students at North Carolina A&T State University. This app will 
serve as a safe and convenient platform for students to buy, sell, or trade items such as textbooks, 
electronics, dorm furniture, and other necessities. By restricting access to users with verified 
university email addresses, we aim to foster a trusted community while promoting affordability 
and sustainability among students. The app will include features like secure in-app messaging, 
user profiles with ratings, item listings with images and descriptions, and safety tools like 
suggested meetup locations on campus. With this app, we aim to simplify peer-to-peer 
transactions and create a valuable resource for the student body.
Objectives:
1. Facilitate Peer-to-Peer Transactions: Provide a user-friendly platform that simplifies 
the process of buying, selling, or trading items among students.
2. Enhance Campus Safety: Ensure a secure marketplace by limiting access to verified 
users and including safety features like reporting tools and suggested meetup locations.
3. Promote Sustainability and Affordability: Encourage students to reuse and recycle 
items, reducing waste and saving money.
Deliverables:
1. A Fully Functional Marketplace App: An operational mobile app for both iOS and 
Android platforms, featuring item listings, search functionality, user authentication, and 
in-app messaging.
2. User Documentation: A concise guide detailing how to use the app’s features, including 
creating listings, messaging, and reporting.
3. Project Demo: A live demonstration showcasing the app’s core features, usability, and 
benefits for students
